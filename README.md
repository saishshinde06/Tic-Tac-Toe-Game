Project Name - Tic Tac Toe 

The code you provided is a Tic Tac Toe game built using the Tkinter library in Python. Tkinter is used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game, where a human player can play against the computer. Let's break down the key components of the code and explain what libraries are being used and how they contribute to the functionality:
Libraries Used:

    tkinter:
        This is the main library used to build the graphical interface of the game. Tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, which allows you to create windows, buttons, labels, and other graphical elements. In this code, Tkinter is used to create the main game window, buttons for each grid cell, and a reset button.
    tkinter.messagebox:
        This is a submodule of Tkinter that provides pop-up dialog boxes, such as showing information or error messages. In your code, it is used to display a message when the game ends (either the player wins, the computer wins, or it's a draw).

Summary:

The Tkinter library is used to build the graphical interface for the Tic Tac Toe game. The game allows a player to play against the computer, 
which uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best moves. The program includes various functions to handle game logic, user interaction, and UI updates. 
The messagebox module is used to display win/loss/drawÂ messages.
